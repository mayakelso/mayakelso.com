                SOAS, University of London, where I was introduced to gamelan, an Indonesian traditional music which
                reshaped the way I think about music, and very much informs the way I teach. I also play guitar (bass
                for 16 years, acoustic and electric for 10) and piano, and produce tracks and DJ using Ableton Live.

                that the student is in charge.</div>
